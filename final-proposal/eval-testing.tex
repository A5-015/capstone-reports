\section{Criteria for Design Evaluation and Testing}
%\subsection{Evaluation Criteria}
%\subsection{Testing Criteria}
We will evaluate and test our design according to the following metrics:

\textit{Network Stability:}
Defined as the percentage of packets delivered to the destination (PDR). The final design will be tested to see if it can achieve a PDR of greater than 85\%.

\textit{Network Realignment Time:}
Defined as the time taken for all of the nodes to arrive to a consensus after the introduction of a new node. The final design will be tested to recover and realign itself in 1000\si{ms}

\textit{Data Transfer Speed \& Bandwidth:}
Defined as the bits per second data transmission rate between nodes. The final design will be tested to see if it can achieve a data rate of 8\si{Mbps} between nodes.

\textit{Power Consumption:}
Defined as the power consumption in \si{W} measured on-board during a test session. The final design will be tested to consume lower than 100\si{mAh} on average for 10 hours usage.

\textit{Scalability \& Coverage:}
Defined as the number of nodes that can be a part of the network before deprecation of network quality within an area \si{m^2}. The final design will be tested to operate with 500 nodes in 1000\si{m^2}.

\textit{Footprint}
Defined as the storage space the library takes. The final compiled code will be tested to fit within 2\si{MB} of flash memory.
