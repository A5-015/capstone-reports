By the end of this project, we will deliver the following: 

\begin{enumerate}

  \item A minimal prototype board with an ESP8266 MCU developed to demonstrate the capabilities of the library 
  \item A capstone report outlining our progress and the documentation of our work.
  \item A capstone presentation outlining our progress and the documentation of our work.
  \item A capstone poster outlining our progress and the documentation of our work.

\end{enumerate}
