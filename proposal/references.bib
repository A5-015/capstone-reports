The proposed network has a three-tier hierarchy consisting of low-power mobile nodes (MNs) at the lowest layer, forwarding nodes (FNs) with higher power and multi-hop routing capability at the middle layer, and wired access points (APs) without power constraints at the highest layer. Specifics of new protocols used for bootstrapping, node discovery and multi-hop routing are presented, and overall operation of the complete hierarchical ad-hoc network is explained. A prototype implementation of the SOHAN network is outlined in terms of major hardware and software components, and initial experimental results are given.}, note={00000}, author={Ganu, S and Zhao, S and Raju, L and Anepu, B and Seskar, I and Raychaudhuri, D}, pages={5} }

However, many real networks can only be correctly described using two different types of relations. Connectivity links that enable the nodes to function cooperatively as a network and dependency links that bind the failure of one network element to the failure of other network elements. Here we present an analytical framework for studying the robustness of networks that include both connectivity and dependency links. We show that a synergy exists between the failure of connectivity and dependency links that leads to an iterative process of cascading failures that has a devastating effect on the network stability. We present exact analytical results for the dramatic change in the network behavior when introducing dependency links. For a high density of dependency links, the network disintegrates in a form of a first-order phase transition, whereas for a low density of dependency links, the network disintegrates in a second-order transition. Moreover, opposed to networks containing only connectivity links where a broader degree distribution results in a more robust network, when both types of links are present a broad degree distribution leads to higher vulnerability.}, note={00234}, number={3}, journal={Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}, author={Parshani, Roni and Buldyrev, Sergey V. and Havlin, Shlomo}, year={2011}, month={Jan}, pages={1007–1010} }

This flexibility provides either a long range at the cost of a lower data rate or higher throughput at the cost of low sensitivity, so a shorter range. In this paper, we analyze the flexibility of LoRa and propose various strategies to adapt its radio parameters (such as the spreading factor, bandwidth, and transmission power) to different deployment scenarios. We compute the energy consumption of LoRa transceivers using various radio configurations in both star and mesh topologies. Our simulation results show that in a star topology, we can achieve the optimal scaling-up/down strategy of LoRa radio parameters to obtain either a high data rate or a long range while respecting low energy consumption. In mesh networks, energy consumption is optimized by exploiting various radio configurations and the network topology (e.g., the number of hops, the network density, the cell coverage). Finally, we propose a strategy to take advantage of both star and mesh topologies.}, booktitle={2017 IEEE 13th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)}, author={Ochoa, Moises Nunez and Guizar, Arturo and Maman, Mickael and Duda, Andrzej}, year={2017}, month={Oct}, pages={1–8} }

WING is an experimental multi-radio WMN testbed designed and built exploiting commodity hardware and open-source software components. WING implements a flexible and scalable WMN architecture capable of supporting next-generation Internet services with a particular focus on multimedia applications. The WING project aims at providing an open-platform on top of which innovative solution can be implemented and tested in a realistic environment. Currently, the testbed consist of 10 nodes deployed at CREATE-NET premises and implementing a two-tiers architecture. Other well-known IEEE 802.11-based WMNs include Roofnet, Hyacinth, Microsoft’s MCL, and Meraki.

 @article{Lee_Ke_2018, title={Monitoring of Large-Area IoT Sensors Using a LoRa Wireless Mesh Network System: Design and Evaluation}, volume={67}, ISSN={1557-9662}, DOI={10/gf4ckz}, abstractNote={Although many techniques exist to transfer data from the widely distributed sensors that make up the Internet of Things (IoT) (e.g., using 3G/4G networks or cables), these methods are associated with prohibitively high costs, making them impractical for real-life applications. Recently, several emerging wireless technologies have been proposed to provide long-range communication for IoT sensors. Among these, LoRa has been examined for long-range performance. Although LoRa shows good performance for long-range transmission in the countryside, its radio signals can be attenuated over distance, and buildings, trees, and other radio signal sources may interfere with the signals. Our observations show that in urban areas, LoRa requires dense deployment of LoRa gateways (GWs) to ensure that indoor LoRa devices can successfully transfer data back to remote GWs. Wireless mesh networking is a solution for increasing communication range and packet delivery ratio (PDR) without the need to install additional GWs. This paper presents a LoRa mesh networking system for large-area monitoring of IoT applications. We deployed 19 LoRa mesh networking devices over an 800 m × 600 m area on our university campus and installed a GW that collected data at 1-min intervals. The proposed LoRa mesh networking system achieved an average 88.49 PDR, whereas the star-network topology used by LoRa achieved only 58.7 under the same settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first academic study discussing LoRa mesh networking in detail and evaluating its performance via real experiments.}, number={9}, journal={IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement}, author={Lee, Huang-Chen and Ke, Kai-Hsiang}, year={2018}, month={Sep}, pages={2177–2187} }

 @article{Leonardi_Patti_Lo_Bello_2018, title={Multi-Hop Real-Time Communications Over Bluetooth Low Energy Industrial Wireless Mesh Networks}, volume={6}, ISSN={2169-3536}, DOI={10/ggdtzg}, abstractNote={Industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) are used to acquire sensor data that need realtime processing, therefore they require predictable behavior and real-time guarantees. To be cost effective, IWSNs are also expected to be low cost and low power. In this context, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is a promising technology, as it allows implementing low-cost industrial networks. As BLE is a shortrange technology, a multihop mesh network is needed to cover a large area. Nevertheless, the recently published Bluetooth mesh networking specifications do not provide support for real-time communications over multihop mesh networks. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes the multihop real-time BLE (MRT-BLE) protocol, a real-time protocol developed on top of BLE, that allows for bounded packet delays over mesh networks. MRT-BLE also provides priority support. This paper describes in detail the MRT-BLE protocol and how to implement it on commercial-off-the-shelf devices. Two kinds of performance evaluation for the MRT-BLE protocol are provided. The first one is a worst case end-to-end delay analysis, while the second one is based on the experimental results obtained through measurements on a real testbed.}, journal={IEEE Access}, author={Leonardi, Luca and Patti, Gaetano and Lo Bello, Lucia}, year={2018}, pages={26505–26519} }

Up to 60 of the energy consumed in a data center is used for cooling in wasteful ways as a result of lack of environmental information and overcompensated cooling systems. In this project, a wireless sensor network for data-enter environmental monitoring was developed to improve energy efficiency and to optimize data-center performance. The sensor network consists of a suite of sensor nodes for data sensing, a router node to relay sensed data, and a coordinator node to establish a network, receive the data, and process the data. The prototype sensor network was built on Arduino open source hardware with a seamlessly integrated XBee RF module and configured to operate within the ZigBee mesh network standard. A 24-hour test run at Argonne’s data center demonstrated that the wireless networked environmental monitoring solution is easy to integrate and manage with the existing IT infrastructure, while delivering better visibility into the data center’s 3D temperature and humidity distribution and substantial improvements in energy efficiency.}, booktitle={2011 Fifth International Conference on Sensing Technology}, author={Rodriguez, Michael G. and Ortiz Uriarte, Luis E. and Yi Jia and Yoshii, Kazutomo and Ross, Robert and Beckman, Peter H.}, year={2011}, month={Nov}, pages={533–537} }
