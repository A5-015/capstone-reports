\section{Impact of COVID-19 on the Project}

In accordance with COVID-19 guidelines, our team had limited access to lab spaces throughout the duration of the project. While this did not significantly impact the project, given its focus on software, it made access to hardware more difficult for testing purposes. Overall, little was changed due to the pandemic as the project timeline and scope were designed with the existing and potential restrictions in mind.
